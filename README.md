# CatShell

Greetings, this is our own iteration of Minishell, a 42 project which is supposed to imitate bash in its functionality.
This was a 2 man project, started and completed within 6 weeks.
I worked on the Execution part, which included managing the redirections, pipes, as well as path setting to access bash functions, and implementing some built-ins, like echo, cd and pwd.

[Tudor](https://github.com/Tudor-Ursescu) was in charge of parsing, which meant splitting the command line into arguments, and fromatting them correctly so the execution part would work without any issues.

we faced some setbacks on our journey of this shell, but with a lot of input and discussions with peers, we managed to finish and evaluate this project with a solid 100 points.

As with any other minishell, there will be some edgecases that we haven't accounted for, or some which we didn't find yet.

But all in all we learned a lot in the process of making this.

Have fun enjoying our minishell :>
